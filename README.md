# music-tagger

This is a small command line app that returns the tags (id3 or otherwise) from a audio file.
It is written in c++ and uses the taglib library, and returns the tags as serialized json on stdout for easy parsing (subject to change).


## Todo

* Should be able to Update tags in file
* Clean up everything
